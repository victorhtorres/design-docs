# Summary | Overview
A brief, high-level overview of the project. It includes the problem being solved, the goals of the API, and a quick overview of how the solution will address those goals.

# Goals and Non-Goals
Define the scope

# Background
Provides context for why this API is needed. It includes information about the current state, any existing systems, or pain points the API is intended to solve. This is important for stakeholders unfamiliar with the problem space.

#Â Assumptions
Lists assumptions the design is based on, such as the technologies used (e.g., OAuth 2.0 for authentication) or expected user behavior. These are key to ensuring all stakeholders are aligned on fundamental aspects of the system.

# Requirements
Defines the technical and functional needs of the system. Requirements are divided into functional and non-functional categories.
Functional Requirements: Specific features the API should provide (e.g., create, update, delete books).
Non-Functional Requirements: Performance, security, and scalability aspects (e.g., API response times, maximum load, data encryption).

# Design Overview
This is a high-level overview of how the system will be architected. It explains the core components and how they interact. It usually includes diagrams like architecture flowcharts to give a visual understanding of the design.

# Detailed Design (optional)
Explain more in detail each part/component of the design overview section

# API Specifications
This is the detailed technical design of the API. It includes information about endpoints, request/response formats, data models, authentication, and authorization. This section is key for developers who will implement and consume the API.
- Endpoints: Lists the available API routes and the operations they perform.
- Data Models: Defines the structure of the data entities (e.g., book, user) used by the API.
- Authentication & Authorization: Details how users authenticate and what access controls will be in place.

# User Interface & Experience
Describes considerations for client applications or user-facing elements of the API. This section is especially relevant if the API has a public or developer-facing UI (e.g., Swagger documentation). It ensures consistent user experiences and usability.

# Technical Considerations
Discusses the technical choices and constraints, including the tech stack, infrastructure, third-party libraries, and other considerations like security, performance, or fault tolerance. This helps justify why specific technologies were chosen and any limitations or trade-offs involved.

# Testing Strategy
Outlines the strategy for testing the API to ensure it works as intended. This includes unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and any other tests needed to validate the functionality and performance of the API.

# Deployment Strategy
Explains how the API will be deployed to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production). It may include information about CI/CD pipelines, containerization, scaling strategies, and monitoring after deployment.

# Future Work
Lists potential features or improvements that are out of scope for the current version but may be considered in future iterations. This helps keep track of ideas that could enhance the API later without adding them to the current project scope.

# References
Provides links to relevant resources such as technical documents, specifications (e.g., OAuth 2.0 or RESTful API standards), or any research papers that influenced the design. This section is helpful for stakeholders who want to dive deeper into specific topics or standards.
